gitfiti _noun_ : carefully crafted graffiti in a github commit history calendar.

`gitfiti.py` is a tool I wrote to decorate your github account's commit history calendar by (blatantly) abusing git.

I highly recommend that you create a _new_ github repo when using gitfiti.

###Usage:
1. Create a new github repo to store your handiwork.
2. Run `gitfiti.py` and follow the prompts for username, art selection, offset, and repo name.
3. Run the generated `gitfiti.sh` from your home directory (or any non-git tracked dir) and watch it go to work.
4. Wait... Seriously, you'll probably need to wait a day or two for the gitfiti to show in your commit graph.

###Removal:
Fortunately if you regret your gitfiti in the morning, removing it is fairly easy: delete the repo you created for your gitfiti (and wait).

####Todo:
- Remove 'requests' dependency
- Web interface
- Load "art" from a file
- Load commit content from a file
- ...
- Profit?
